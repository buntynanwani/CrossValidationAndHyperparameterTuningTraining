    "**Reason 1: Dataset is Perfectly Balanced**\n",

    "- Random K-Fold naturally creates balanced folds\n",
    "- Stratification provides no advantage here\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason 2: Lucky Random Split**\n",
    "- K-Fold got 2 perfect folds (100% accuracy)\n",
    "- This is random luck, not systematic superiority\n",
    "- Different random_state would change results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reason 3: Model is Strong**\n",

    "**K-Fold's Low Variability** (±2.49%):\n",

    "**Classification Tasks**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# ❌ DON'T DO THIS\n",
    "from sklearn.model_selection import KFold\n",
    "cv = KFold(n_splits=5)\n",

    "**Regression Tasks**:\n",

    "3. ✅ **Always set random_state** for reproducibility\n",
    "4. ✅ **Always shuffle=True** unless time-series\n",
