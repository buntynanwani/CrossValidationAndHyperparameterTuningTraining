    "\n",
    "* The score is the average of 150 individual test scores.\n",

    "### 🎯 When to Use LOOCV\n",
    "\n",
    "LOOCV is **rarely used** in modern Machine Learning due to its heavy computational cost. It is only considered in specific, niche situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Tiny Datasets:** When $N$ is very small (e.g., $N < 50$), and you need to maximize the training data for every single fold.\n",
    "2.  **Model Bias is Critical:** When minimizing the bias (the difference between the training set size and the full dataset size) is the most important factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 99% of tasks, **K-Fold ($K=5$ or $K=10$)** is the superior choice, offering a great balance between accuracy and speed.\n",
