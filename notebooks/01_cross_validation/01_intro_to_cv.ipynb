    "\n",
    "1. **The Single Split was Optimistic (and Likely Unreliable):**  \n",

    "   * If you had relied only on that $4.998 score, you would have **overestimated** your model's real-world accuracy.  \n",
    "2. **The CV Score is the Honest Grade:**  \n",
    "   * The **Average MAE of $6.116** is the model's true, general performance. This score is much more trustworthy because it ensures that **every part of your data** has been used fairly for testing.  \n",
    "3. **The Model's Performance Varies:**  \n",
    "   * The **Individual MAE Scores** ranged from **$4.311** to **$8.290**.  \n",
    "   * The **Standard Deviation of 1.571** shows that the model's prediction accuracy changes significantly depending on the time period it's tested on. A high standard deviation means the model is **not perfectly stable**.  \n",
    "   * This is a strong sign that the model may be struggling with high **variance** (a form of instability), which is exactly what CV is designed to expose\\!\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary, Cross-Validation gave your model an honest, overall grade of $6.116, revealing that its performance is less stable than the single initial test suggested.**"
