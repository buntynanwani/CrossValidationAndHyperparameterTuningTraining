    "**That is a common and important warning when using Bayesian Optimization with the `scikit-optimize` library (`skopt`).**\n",

    "\n",
    "**UserWarning: The objective has been evaluated at point \\[...\\] before, using random point \\[...\\]**\n",
    "\n",
    "**occur because the Bayesian optimization process is trying to select the most *promising* next point to evaluate, but it has accidentally selected a hyperparameter combination that it has already tested in a previous iteration.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's a breakdown of why this happens and why `skopt` switches to a random point:**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **🧠 Why the Warnings Appear in `BayesSearchCV`**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayesian Optimization works by balancing exploration (trying new, unknown regions of the parameter space) and exploitation (testing near the best-performing points found so far).**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1\\. The Core Mechanism**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Surrogate Model: `skopt` builds a Gaussian Process model (the surrogate) to estimate the model's performance across the entire search space.**  \n",
    "2. **Acquisition Function: It uses this surrogate model to find the next point that maximizes the Expected Improvement (EI)—the point where the score is likely to be best.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2\\. The Collision (The Warning)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due to the nature of continuous sampling (especially when using `Integer` ranges and a limited number of unique candidates):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The acquisition function may calculate that the optimal next point is a set of hyperparameters (e.g., `max_depth=18`, `n_estimators=200`) that was already tested in a previous iteration.**  \n",
    "* **Since re-evaluating an already-tested point is a waste of time and computational resources, `skopt` uses a guardrail.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3\\. The `skopt` Fallback (The Resolution)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **When `skopt` detects that the chosen \"optimal\" point is a duplicate, it discards that point and instead selects a new, purely random point from the search space to continue the process.**  \n",
    "* **This ensures the tuning process moves forward and doesn't get stuck in a loop.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **📝 Is This a Problem?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**No, this is generally NOT a problem for the final result of your tuning.**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The tuning process is still valid: `skopt` intelligently avoids wasted time by switching to an untested point.**  \n",
    "2. **It's common: This happens frequently, especially when the search space is limited or when the best hyperparameters are clustered together.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**You can safely ignore these warnings. They are simply information about the internal decision-making process of the Bayesian optimizer.**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Successive Halving** is a method that treats hyperparameter candidates like competitors in a tournament:\n",

    "1.  **Round 1:** Test *many* candidates on a **small subset** of the training data (e.g., 20% of samples).\n",
