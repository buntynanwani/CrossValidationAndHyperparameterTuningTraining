    "\n",
    "**Random Search** is a powerful and efficient alternative to Grid Search. Instead of testing *every* single combination in a predefined grid:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  It randomly samples a **fixed number of combinations** from the specified hyperparameter distributions.\n",

    "\n",
    "Grid Search wastes time testing redundant points (e.g., trying a shallow tree with many split points). Random Search focuses its limited computational budget on exploring different *regions* of the parameter space, often finding a near-optimal or even better solution faster than Grid Search.\n",
