    "\n",
    "### For This Supplement Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "**Short-term (1-2 months)**:\n",
    "1. ✅ Deploy TimeSeriesSplit + Random Forest ($5.08 MAE)\n",
    "2. Collect more data (target: 200+ samples)\n",
    "3. Add external features:\n",
    "   - Competitor prices\n",
    "   - Market indices\n",
    "   - Google Trends data\n",
    "   - Promotional calendar\n",
    "4. Try XGBoost/LightGBM (often beat RF on tabular data)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Long-term (3-6 months)**:\n",
    "1. Test SARIMA (designed for seasonal time-series)\n",
    "2. Try LSTM/GRU if data reaches 200+ samples\n",

    "### For Any ML Project\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Golden Rules**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Know Your Data Structure**\n",
    "   - Time-series? → TimeSeriesSplit\n",
    "   - Classification (imbalanced)? → Stratified K-Fold\n",
    "   - Regression (no time)? → K-Fold\n",
    "   - Spatial data? → GroupKFold\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Start Simple, Then Complexify**\n",
    "   - Linear models first (baseline)\n",
    "   - Tree-based methods second (Random Forest, XGBoost)\n",
    "   - Deep learning LAST (and only if warranted)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Rigorous Validation**\n",
    "   - 5-10 folds minimum (not 3)\n",
    "   - Multiple time periods for time-series\n",
    "   - Accept negative R² as truth\n",
    "   - Report mean AND standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Question Your Results**\n",
    "   - Too good? → Check for data leakage\n",
    "   - High variance? → Model unstable\n",
    "   - Negative R²? → Wrong architecture\n",
    "   - Single test? → Not enough evidence\n",
